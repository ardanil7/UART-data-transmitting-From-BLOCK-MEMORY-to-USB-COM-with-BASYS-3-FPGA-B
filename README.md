# UART-data-transmitting-From-BLOCK-MEMORY-to-USB-COM-with-BASYS-3-FPGA-B
For this transition process 9600 Baud_Rate has been implemented and data has covered and sent from Block  Single Channel Read only Memory. 
Fro this transition, latency in data block is considered 20 ns and when it comes to calculating Baud Rate it was also considered.
